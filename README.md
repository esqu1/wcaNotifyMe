# WCA NotifyMe

The biggest frustration of signing up for WCA competitions is not finding out about them in time. 
An even bigger frustration, however, is when you do find out about a competition, but then 
get shut out of registration!

*WCA NotifyMe* serves to alleviate that frustration. Simply sign up for notifications
and you'll be notified when it's time to register for your next competition!
